The posts have the ability to be reflected or pinned on the map of the city like an road block event or new shop opening posts these have time limits and will be removed from map

some posts can be permanant markers on the map like tourists spots but need a vote in the community to be placed permanantly


The concept of the application is to people to create communities of their own cities, share info and organise together for their own cities development

Have to add some kind of safety checks on the app to not become like other social media shit posting app like quora or instagram
